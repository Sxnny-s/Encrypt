# US Tax Rates Lookup

This project allows users to fetch and display US tax rates by entering a ZIP code. The application takes user input, processes it, and dynamically displays the tax rate information. It uses a simple HTML interface styled with CSS and functionality implemented in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Users can enter a ZIP code to get tax rate details.
- **Dynamic Data**: Displays results in real-time upon submission.
- **Modern Design**: Styled with CSS for a clean and responsive interface.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a valid ZIP code in the input field.
2. **Fetch Data**: When the "Submit" button is clicked, a JavaScript function sends a request to fetch the corresponding tax rate.
3. **Display Results**: The tax rate is displayed below the input field dynamically.
